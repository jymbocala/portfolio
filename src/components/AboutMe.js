              I have a background in highschool teaching, in which I have a
              Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Education. I specialised in Business
              Studies and Commerce. Teaching in any form, and sharing my knowledge
              to people has been a passion of mine since I was young.

              I'm currently on the journey to a career in techðŸ’»! Before learning
              to code, I've always thought it was something too difficult for me
              to pursue. But, with encouragement from my brother, a React
              Developer , I finally gave it a go. Turns out, it was the best
              decision I made! My hunger to learn coding grew fast and I started
              learning actively. Today, I am aspiring to be a Frontend Developer.

              Being a teacher, I have come to understand the importance and value
              in lifelong learning. I bring that attitude to coding, where each
              new concept, technology or framework that I learn brings a sense of
              excitement and challenge. Also, teaching people to code, even if
              they're only a couple of steps behind me, is something I'm
              passionate about. So, aspiring devs and those on the fence about
              starting to learn coding, feel free to message me any questions, and
              I'll do my best for you!
